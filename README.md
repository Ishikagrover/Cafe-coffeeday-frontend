📌 Project Overview
The Cafe Coffee Day Front-End Clone is a web development project that aims to replicate the design and basic functionality of the official Cafe Coffee Day (CCD) website. It focuses on creating an intuitive, clean, and interactive user interface where customers can explore a coffee menu, add items to their cart, and view their selections. This project showcases strong command over HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design principles.

🎯 Objectives
The goal of this project is to provide users with a seamless browsing and ordering experience through a modern, responsive website. It is built purely using front-end technologies and can be used as a base for developing a full-stack version in the future. The design mimics the branding and aesthetics of the real CCD website to make it visually appealing and familiar.

💻 Technologies Used
HTML5: To structure the web pages and components like headers, product cards, and buttons.

CSS3: To style the website and bring consistency across different sections using custom styles and layout techniques.

JavaScript: For adding dynamic behavior such as adding items to the cart, updating quantities, and displaying item totals.

Bootstrap: For implementing responsive design, ensuring the site looks good on both mobile and desktop devices.

🛒 Key Features
Home Page: A visually attractive landing page with a welcome section and featured menu items.

Menu Section: Lists various coffee drinks, snacks, and combos with images, descriptions, and prices.

Cart Functionality: Users can click on “Add to Cart” buttons, and the selected items will be reflected in a cart section.

Responsive Layout: All pages adapt to different screen sizes using media queries and Bootstrap’s grid system.
